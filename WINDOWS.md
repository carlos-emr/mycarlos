# Windows evaluation download

This is an **unsigned synthetic-data evaluation**, not a patient release. Signing and the
security/privacy/device release gates remain open.

## Download and install

1. Sign in to GitHub and open the [Windows evaluation builds](https://github.com/carlos-emr/mycarlos/actions/workflows/mycarlos.yml?query=branch%3Amain).
2. Choose the newest run with a successful **Windows native build** job. In its summary, click **Download Windows x64 evaluation
   installer**, or select **myCarlos-Windows-x64-Evaluation** under **Artifacts**.
3. Extract the ZIP and run `myCarlos-Evaluation-Windows-x64-setup.exe`.
4. Launch **myCarlos Evaluation** from Start. Create a fictional profile and test passphrase,
   then import PDFs from the ZIP's `sample-files` folder.

The x64 installer targets ordinary Intel/AMD Windows PCs. It installs for the current user and
includes the WebView2 bootstrapper; if the runtime is missing, setup needs internet access to
install it. No development tools are required. Windows on ARM has not been validated here.

The ZIP includes `START-HERE.txt`, the installer, sample PDFs, its SHA-256 checksum, and a
`BUILD.txt` identifying the exact source commit and workflow run. Downloads are retained for
30 days. Updates are manual; use the same link to find a newer build. Another job, such as the
unsupported Linux compatibility monitor, can fail while the Windows job succeeds; use any run
whose **Windows native build** job succeeded. These artifacts are for synthetic-data evaluation
only.

Windows may warn about an unknown publisher or block this unsigned build, particularly on
managed computers. Do not disable Windows security controls to install it. An installer produced
successfully by CI is build evidence; physical-device installation testing remains required.

The application uses the Windows GUI subsystem even in evaluation/debug builds, so opening it
from Start does not also open a terminal. CI checks the installed executable's subsystem before
publishing the download. Earlier evaluation installers only hid the console in release builds;
install a newer build if a terminal appears alongside the app.

To erase evaluation data, use **Security > Erase entire vault** before uninstalling. App removal
can leave app-data files behind, and vault reset cannot erase readable exports.

## Moving documents with drag and drop

Use **Choose files to import** to bring PDFs into the vault. Dragging files from Windows File
Explorer into the app is not implemented. Once imported, drag a document or folder onto a folder
in the main view or sidebar to move it. Drop onto **My records** to move it back to the root.
Selected documents can be moved together. The **Move selected to** control is also available.

The window sets `dragDropEnabled: false` so HTML drag events reach the interface. Tauri's default
native file-drop handler intercepts these events on Windows; see the
[Tauri configuration reference](https://v2.tauri.app/reference/config/#windowconfig).
The earlier evaluation build from September 14 omitted this setting. Install a newer build to
receive the fix. Browser event tests cannot validate Windows WebView2 drag routing, so physical
Windows testing must include document and folder moves in both list and grid views, sidebar/root
drops, and confirmation that external file drops do not navigate away from the vault.

## Renaming folders and documents

Choose **Rename** beside a folder in list or grid view, or open it and choose **Rename folder**.
Open an imported document's details and choose **Rename document** to edit its file name.
Choose **Save name** to commit, or **Cancel** / Escape to leave the name unchanged.

Renames persist in the encrypted vault and update search, sorting, navigation, and the suggested
export name. Folder locations, document contents, and original files outside myCarlos are unchanged.
A document keeps its extension, such as `.pdf`: only the name before it can be changed. Empty names
are rejected. Document names that contain a path or an unsafe Windows file name are rejected and
limited to 240 UTF-8 bytes, including the extension; folder names are limited to 120 characters.
Renaming is unavailable while the vault is locked or in read-only recovery mode.

## Getting a trusted Windows signature

Use **Azure Artifact Signing (Public Trust)** for direct Windows downloads. Microsoft's
[code-signing guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/package-and-deploy/code-signing-options)
lists approximately US$9.99/month and supports Canadian organizations and individuals. A
consistent publisher identity matters: signed new builds can still show SmartScreen warnings
while reputation develops. DCO sign-off on Git commits is separate from executable signing.

The account owner must complete the [Azure setup and identity validation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/artifact-signing/quickstart):

1. Choose the legal publisher name that should appear in Windows and create the Azure subscription
   and Artifact Signing account under that owner.
2. Complete public identity validation and create a **Public Trust** certificate profile.
3. Configure a [GitHub Actions federated identity](https://github.com/Azure/artifact-signing-action/blob/main/docs/OIDC.md)
   with signing permission scoped to that profile.
   Keep signing in a protected release environment on a trusted branch, separate from PR builds.
4. Connect that identity and profile to Tauri's Windows `signCommand`, following the
   [Tauri Windows signing guide](https://v2.tauri.app/distribute/sign/windows/). Sign the application
   executable before packaging, then sign and timestamp the finished installer.
5. Verify both signatures with Windows `Get-AuthenticodeSignature`/SignTool before uploading
   signed downloads. Publish from the approved release pipeline after the remaining release gates.

No signing account, paid subscription, certificate, or credentials are created by this PR.
The current PR workflow intentionally has no signing permissions or credentials.

For an open-source alternative, the [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/)
offers signing to qualifying projects. Eligibility and onboarding are separate from this build.
